2021-03-29  Cells change color when mouse moves over them. Created button for deleting grid and setting up new one. Added some styling and positioning.

2021-03-31  Tried making function to grab current cell rgba values, increase transparency value by 0.1 making it darker. Worked up to this point and got stuck, wanted to put it back into cell, effectively making cell color darker with every mouse click. (line 59). I will come back to this part some time later.
